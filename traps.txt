Q: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: a0 - a7 and fa0 - fa7. a3 holds 13.

Q: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A:
f is called in main at:
  22:	0800                	add	s0,sp,16
  printf("%d %d\n", f(8)+1, 13);
  24:	4635                	li	a2,13
g is called by f at:
  12:	0800                	add	s0,sp,16
  return g(x);

Q: At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x630

Q: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x38

Q: Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
